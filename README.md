# Slips

https://ga-dc.github.io/slips

Add new slips to the `master` branch, keeping them grouped by topic.

The `gh-pages` branch is totally malleable. When you're prepping Slips for a class, just pull down `master`, change `slips.json` however you'd like, and push to `gh-pages`.

Add students to `classes.json` in the same fashion.
